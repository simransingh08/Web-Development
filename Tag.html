        <Lorem><p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy 
            text of the printing and 
            <u>typesetting </u> industry. Lorem 
            Ipsum has been the industry's 
            standard <del>dummy text </del>ever since
             the 1500s, when an unknown 
             printer took a galley of type 
             and scrambled it to make a 
             type <i>specimen book.</i></p> It has 
             survived not only five 
             centuries, but also the leap 
             into <b>electronic typesetting,</b> 
             remaining <strong>essentially</strong> unchanged.
            It was popularised in the 1960s 
            with the release of Letraset 
            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
            passages, and more <mark>recently </mark> with 
            desktop publishing software like 
            Aldus PageMaker including versions
             of Lorem</Lorem>-->
